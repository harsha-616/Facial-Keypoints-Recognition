# Facial Keypoints Recognition

Facial Keypoints Recognition is a deep learning-based project that detects key facial landmarks from images. This project can be used for facial recognition, emotion detection, augmented reality, and more.

## Features

- Detects key facial points such as eyes, nose, mouth, and chin.
- Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction.
- Trained on a dataset of facial images with annotated keypoints.
- Supports visualization of detected keypoints.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a publicly available facial keypoints dataset. It includes:

- Images of human faces
- Corresponding labeled keypoints (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth corners)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Facial-Keypoints-Recognition.git
cd Facial-Keypoints-Recognition
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:

```bash
jupyter notebook Facial Keypoints Recognition.ipynb
```

To test on a single image:

```python
python test_model.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## Model Architecture

The model consists of:

- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Fully connected layers for keypoint regression
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
